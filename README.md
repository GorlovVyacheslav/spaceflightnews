# Intro
Test task for " Codebridge".

I've been using CRA for bootstraping application here a couple of requirements:

- usage of MUI
- Usage of state
- Figma layout (https://www.figma.com/file/h1veXmuEt84sT7PEZgF42K/Frontend_test?node-id=475%3A573&t=ZthhUXb4yMjPRGQ6-0)

## How to start?

bash
npm install
npm start


 Deployed to free tier of netlify: horlovspaceflightnews.netlify.app


## Task

 You need to build Single Page Application with React.

The following Figma low-fidelity prototype should be used as a basis: link.

Use any open API to get article names and descriptions. For example:

https://spaceflightnewsapi.net/
Home page should contain:

1. Cards with article titles and descriptions for 100 characters. The user can click on the card to go to an article page that contains the title and full description of the selected article.

2. A field to filter by keyword. The user enters keywords into the field and the system displays all articles containing at least one of the keywords in the name or/and description.

The priority of fields: (1) names; and (2) description. The article with one match in the name is higher than the article with one match in the description.

The matched keywords should be highlighted with yellow color.

What do we expect?

Please use TypeScript as the main language.
CSS preprocessors should be used.
Please use Material UI.
Showing an example of a custom hook will be a plus.
Showing an example of state management will be a big plus.

# Getting Started with Create React App




This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More
